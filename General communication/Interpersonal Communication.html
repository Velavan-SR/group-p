        <h1>What are interpersonal communication skills?</h1>
        <p>Interpersonal communication skills are the tools we use to let others know what we think, feel, need and want. And they are how we let others know that we understand what they think, feel, need and want.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What are the benefits of improving interpersonal communication skills?</h2>
        <p>Even those who are individual contributors in the workplace need to be able to communicate effectively with bosses and customers. Most people have colleagues with whom they need to communicate in order to be successful at their job. Every one of us has her/his own preferred style of communicating with others. In addition, given our unique histories, we have different strategies for communicating in different types of situations. </p> As a result, there is a very real possibility that when two of us get together there are certain circumstances in which we are less effective at communicating with each other than we would like. By increasing your repertoire of interpersonal communication skills, you can increase your overall effectiveness and perhaps your job satisfaction.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>The Importance of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
        <p>Interpersonal communication is a valuable "soft skill" in many job descriptions. Strong interpersonal communication skills help people better express their emotions and thoughts and cultivate a stronger sense of empathy for others. </p>

            Interpersonal communication is also a vital part of being a team player or a group leader, things that recruiters are always looking for. </p>
            
            If you have solid interpersonal communication skills, you can clearly express your intentions and thoughts, enriching your professional relationships and personal life. </p>
            
            So many conflicts stem from simple misunderstandings. Strong interpersonal communication skills help reduce the likelihood of these misunderstandings, which subsequently lowers the risk of arguments, hurt feelings, grudges, and problems with morale.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Types of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
        <p>The first step in answering “what is interpersonal communication?” is breaking it down into four distinct types.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verbal: </strong> In other words, speaking. This term covers the words you use, how persuasively you speak, the language you use, which words you emphasize, and even the use of affirmative sounds and short phrases like “Yup” or “Uh-huh.”</li></p>
                <li><strong>Listening: </strong> You can make a good case for listening as the most important interpersonal communication skill. It covers the ability to listen attentively, whether you’re using your ears to listen “in-person” or some other means, say, over the Internet. Listening also includes special techniques like reflection and clarification. The best listeners are people who can focus their attention on the speaker to make the latter feel like they're the sole and most important person in the room.</li></p>
                <li><strong>The Written Word:</strong>  Thanks to the Internet age and situations requiring isolation (e.g., the pandemic), good written communication skills have become an asset. Whether you're on social media, in the workplace, or even texting on your phone, you must know how to get your point across in writing. This type includes emojis, grammar, clarity, tone, and even punctuation. After all, there's a vast difference between "Let's eat, Grandma!" and "Let's eat Grandma!"</li></p>
                <li><strong>Non-Verbal:</strong> This final type covers body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures. Again, it's essential that the listener picks up and correctly interprets non-verbal cues.</li></p>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>How to Build Interpersonal Communication Skills</h2>
        <p>Building interpersonal communication skills can help you improve your relationships, increase your ability to collaborate effectively with others, and enhance your overall success in life. Here are some tips to help you develop them:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Practice active listening: </strong>  One of the most important aspects of interpersonal communication is active listening. This involves fully concentrating on what the other person is saying, without interrupting or judging them. You can practice active listening by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and asking questions to clarify their message.</li></p>
            <li> <strong>Use clear and concise language: </strong> Communication is most effective when it is clear and concise. Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that others may not understand.</li></p>
            <li> <strong>Be aware of nonverbal communication: </strong> Nonverbal communication, such as body language and facial expressions, can also convey messages. Be aware of your own nonverbal cues and try to read others' body language to better understand their message.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Show empathy: </strong> Empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings of others. When communicating with others, try to put yourself in their shoes and show understanding and compassion for their perspective.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Build rapport: </strong> Building rapport involves finding common ground and establishing a connection with others. This can help to build trust and enhance communication. Look for common interests or experiences, and use humor or other forms of positive reinforcement to build a positive relationship.</li></p>
            <li><strong>Be open to feedback: </strong> Be open to constructive criticism and feedback from others, and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>The Four Principles of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
        <p>We have one more set of breakdowns to cover. Whenever you communicate with people, you should keep in mind these four principles. If you do, your interpersonal communication technique will improve, and your messages will be more effective.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It’s Unavoidable: </strong> Unless you’re a hermit living in a cave, you will inevitably interact with others in one manner or another. Even if you’re a shut-in, thanks to something like a quarantine, you will still have the opportunity for interpersonal communication (e.g., phone, Skype, texting).</li></p>
            <li><strong>It’s Irreversible: </strong>  You may be familiar with the phrase “I can’t unsee that.” You can't take back what you have written or said. Even if you make amends with an apology or try to walk back your comments, people don't forget words easily. And remember, Internet content is forever.</li></p>
            <li><strong>It’s Complicated: </strong>  You would think the act of speaking and hearing would be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, everyday life is complicated and interpersonal communication is filled with pitfalls. Not everyone has the same frame of reference or is equally adept at picking up subtle clues or getting the hint. Some speakers assume that everything they say is taken the right way because the listeners must obviously be on the same wavelength as they are (spoiler alert: this is not always the case).</li></p>
            <li> <strong>t’s Contextual:</strong> Sometimes, we can't control what people hear our message, where they are, their mood and mindset, and their level of comprehension. But, again, this harkens to the section dealing with interpersonal communication elements, specifically the context.</li></p>
            <li></li>
