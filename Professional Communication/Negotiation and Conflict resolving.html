        <h1>Conflict Negotiation: Strategies and Skills</h1>
        <p>Conflict can be a common part of many workplaces. While conflict can encourage change and inspire new ideas and processes, it's important to know how to negotiate during conflicts. This skill allows you to reach a reasonable outcome among all parties. In this article, we explain what conflict negotiation is, how to negotiate conflicts effectively and what skills you can develop to be a good conflict negotiator.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What is conflict negotiation?</h2>
        <p>Conflict negotiation is communication focused on finding an agreement that addresses the concerns of parties who want different outcomes. Common situations that involve handling conflicts in negotiation include:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compensation: </strong> Whether setting a salary for a new employee or entering a contract with a vendor, finding a mutually acceptable rate often requires negotiating between differing ideas of fair pay.</li></p>
                <li> <strong>Disputes between employees: </strong> Employees may sometimes encounter conflict about responsibilities or work quality. Resolving these concerns through conflict negotiation is a primary duty of many supervisors and managers.</li></p>
                <li> <strong>Disputes between a business and the public: </strong> Businesses that serve the public sometimes need to respond to a dissatisfied customer or group of concerned individuals. For example, a restaurant manager could enter conflict negotiation with a dissatisfied customer to resolve an issue with a meal.</li></p>
                <li><strong>Disagreements during collaboration: </strong>  Project teams could encounter conflict on factors like how to use limited resources or approach a client request.</li></p>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What are the conflict negotiation models?</h2>
        <p>Here are four models often used to find solutions in conflict negotiation, with examples:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Integrative negotiation or win-win approach</h3>
        <p>In this approach, both parties achieve or exceed their goals in a value-creating process. Both parties look for solutions that benefit each side, integrating the goals into one main approach. An added benefit of this approach is that it creates a positive connection for future negotiations.</p>
        <h4>Example: </h4>
        <p>A salesperson is looking for a new job that requires less travel or a higher salary to compensate for travel expenses. During salary negotiations with a company, they ask to either travel less or receive more pay. The employer can't afford to pay the salesperson a higher salary, so they offer less travel with the possibility of some telecommuting. This is an integrative negotiation because the salesperson can travel less and the employer can hire a talented candidate within their company budget.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Distributive negotiation or win-lose approach</h3>
        <p>A distributive negotiation is when only one party can gain benefits. This type of negotiation is common when there's a limited resource or the team can only try one approach. Negotiating a specific price for a product is often distributive negotiation, since there can be only one agreed-upon price.</p>
        <h4>Example: </h4>
        <p>A talent agency signs a promising client who could bring in a lot of profit. Since only one agent can represent the client, each agent needs to make a proposition for why they're the most suitable employee for the job.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Lose-lose approach</h3>
        <p>In a lose-lose approach, neither party receives the outcome they wanted. In some cases, each side negotiates for part of their desired goal, but they don't get everything they expected.</p>
        <h4>Example: </h4>
        <p>Two clothing retailers in the same shopping center attempt to undercut the other's sale price to get more holiday shoppers. If a negotiation to advertise the same discount rates for the season doesn't work as intended, both stores may continually lower prices to the point that neither store profits.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Compromise approach</h3>
        <p>In the compromise approach, both parties attempt to avoid a lose-lose outcome by acknowledging they could benefit from accepting a result that limits negative consequences.</p>
        <h4>Example: </h4>
        <p> If the same two clothing retailers agree to advertise a sale price lower than originally intended but still profitable, they have made a compromise.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>How to negotiate conflict effectively</h2>
        <p>Before entering a conflict negotiation, consider these strategies to achieve the best outcome:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>1. Clearly define goals</h2>
        <p>It's important to define your desired outcome ahead of time to ensure you stay focused. Think about the specific numbers, time frame and outcomes you want so you have something defined for your negotiation. Specific goals can also help you make stronger and clearer arguments.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. Consider the other party's background</h2>
        <p>Negotiations can sometimes involve international businesses or individuals from different cultural backgrounds. A successful conflict negotiation strategy often involves being mindful of how different organizations and professionals conduct business. Focus on the individuals you are directly resolving a conflict with and how you both can mutually benefit from the process.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>3. Be proactive</h2>
        <p>Being proactive can deescalate or eliminate conflict and encourage a positive atmosphere. If you think you're close to a conflict with a coworker or witness a potential conflict among team members, proactively identifying the challenge and attempting to resolve it can show that your focus is on bettering your work relationships and environment.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>4. Know your role</h2>
        <p>Depending on your position within a company, your role in conflict negotiation might be different. If you're in a leadership position, it's probably your responsibility to understand your company's guidelines for settling internal disputes and policies for entering negotiations with vendors or third parties. As a team member, you might have the following roles:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A mediator who suggests solutions to conflicts</li></p>
                <li>A witness who provides input for others' negotiations</li></p>
                <li>A teacher who shares conflict negotiation strategies</li></p>
                <li>A negotiator for yourself, responsible for representing your own interests</li></p>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>5. Use established forums for negotiating conflicts</h2>
        <p>Regardless of your role, it can be helpful for your workplace to have a designated time to discuss issues that require negotiated solutions. Having a well-defined forum, such as a weekly meeting or shared document where colleagues can share their concerns, can help team members feel more comfortable expressing their opinions. For more private or sensitive conflict negotiations, you may want to approach the other party separately or ask a human resources representative act as a mediator.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>6. Be flexible with time</h2>
        <p>How you use time in a negotiation often reflects what you wish to achieve. In some cases, being firm with a resolution deadline can encourage a more direct and productive conversation. Other conflict negotiations can take time to discuss various points and counterpoints. Being willing to meet on multiple occasions over a longer period of time might produce a better negotiated outcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>7. Focus on creating value</h2>
        <p>Negotiations may begin because of conflicting positions, but a creative, value-oriented mindset can produce the win-win results that leave both parties satisfied. When considering the other party, know where your interests overlap and what your similarities are. Consider what trade-offs you might be willing to accept or propose to the other party that could benefit both sides of the deal.</p>

        <h1>Skills needed to negotiate conflicts</h1>
        <p>Conflict negotiation techniques involve various persuasive, analytical and interpersonal skills, such as:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Emotional intelligence</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to control your own emotions and recognize others' feelings. Being conscious of the emotional dynamics during conflict negotiation can allow you to remain calm and focused on the core issues. If you're unsatisfied with the current negotiation, express the need for a break so you and the other party can return later with refreshed perspectives.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Expectation management</h2>
        <p>Just as you should enter a conflict negotiation with a clear goal, the other party also likely has its own defined expectations. If you believe you might not be able to agree to each other's terms, you could try adjusting your own expectations. Skilled expectation management involves maintaining a balance between being a firm negotiator and a collaborative one.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Performing research can help support your claims and start a foundation for your negotiation. By beginning a negotiation with a fact-driven and open-minded assessment of the issues and sharing useful insights, you and the other party may better understand how the conflict originated and how to solve it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Empathy</h2>
        <p>Empathy allows you to understand the other party's perspective and negotiate toward a win-win approach. This skill is useful for maintaining positive and productive conflict negotiations that produce lasting connections.</p>
